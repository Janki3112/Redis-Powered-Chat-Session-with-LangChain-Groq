### Chat Session with LangChain & Groq Using Redis 
This Python application provides a persistent, personalized chatbot session with Redis saving chat history, and LangChain controlling interaction with the language model. The experience is entirely managed by Redis, thus when User 'x' starts a session, it can be accessed by the 'x' User and the chat history would be pulled from Redis. Therefore, personalized conversations are possible, even after stopping the app and restarting it.  

📦 Features  
✅ Chat History saved to Redis by User id  
✅ Stateful conversation using RunnableWithMessageHistory  
✅ Connects to Groq's llama3-8b-8192 with LangChain  
✅ Command line interface  
✅ Can resume previous session  
✅ Easy to modify and can support other Users orbacks




🚀 How to Setup Environment and Redis 
updated soon...


Make sure Redis is running locally on localhost:6379  
- You can get docker image for redis allot default port (6379) to it and for Redis UI allot port (8001)

Make sure you have an API key for Groq (saved as GROQ_API_KEY in the environment)  

🚀 How to Run
Run the script:  
```
python redis_chat_with_history.py
```  
When prompted, enter your User id. For example: 
```
👤 Please enter your User ID: user_123
```  
You can now ask questions: 
```
>>>> What is the capital of Japan?
```  
At any moment in your session, you can exit with: 
```
>>>> exit
```  
In Redis, your entire conversation regarding the UserID will have been saved. When the app is run again for the same User id, the conversational history could be resumed.
